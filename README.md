# MSSAkit
A Python toolkit to analyse time series using Multivariate Singular Spectral Analysis (MSSA)

# Readme and User Guide

The 'MSSAkit' package implements Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA) as the main function in python. It implements also the Monte Carlo hypothesis to test the significance of the MSSA decompositions.

The methodology is based on:
Groth, A., Feliks, Y., Kondrashov, D. and Ghil, M., 2017. Interannual variability in the North Atlantic oceanâ€™s temperature field and its association with the wind stress forcing. Journal of Climate, 30(7), pp.2655-2678 (https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0370.1).

Beside MSSA, this package is also complemented with other functions of source separation, including:
- Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Cross Singular Value Decomposition (cross SVD)
